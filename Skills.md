# Concept Used:

1. Bi-Variate Analysis
2. 2-sample t-test: testing for difference across populations
3. ANNOVA
4. Chi-square

# Process Involved:

1. Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
2. Try establishing a relation between the dependent and independent variable (Dependent “Count” & Independent: Workingday, Weather, Season etc)
3. Select an appropriate test to check whether:
4. Working Day has effect on number of electric cycles rented
5. No. of cycles rented similar or different in different seasons
6. No. of cycles rented similar or different in different weather
7. Weather is dependent on season (check between 2 predictor variable)
8. Set up Null Hypothesis (H0)
9. State the alternate hypothesis (H1)
10. Check assumptions of the test (Normality, Equal Variance). You can check it using Histogram, Q-Q plot or statistical methods like levene’s test, Shapiro-wilk test (optional)
11. Please continue doing the analysis even If some assumptions fail (levene’s test or Shapiro-wilk test) but double check using visual analysis and report wherever necessary
12. Set a significance level (alpha)
13. Calculate test Statistics.
14. Decision to accept or reject null hypothesis.
15. Inference from the analysis
